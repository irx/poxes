poxes
=====

The poxes library is a primitive ncurses replacement
that handles its most basic functionalities.

So far it provides a way to easily switch between raw
and cooked terminal modes, move cursor to a specific location,
handle terminal window resize and {clear,save,restore} its contents.

Run `make install', include with `#include <poxes.h>'
and link by adding `-lpoxes' flag.
